# Identification-of-Frost-in-Martian-HiRISE-Images
This project focuses on building a classifier to distinguish images of Martian terrain that contain frost using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning. The dataset, which contains images from NASA's HiRISE camera on Mars, is used to study Mars' seasonal frost cycle and its role in climate and surface evolution.
